👋 Hi, I'm Thomas Salamone

🎓 I’m a first-year student at ITS Tech Talent Factory, currently enrolled in the Big Data Engineer & Solution Architect program. My goal is to become a Data Engineer.

💡 Working with data excites me because it combines logic and problem solving — two skills I strive to improve every day.
